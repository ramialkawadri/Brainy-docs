# Reviewer

The reviewer allows you to review the repetitions for the cells and assists 
you with spaced repetition by applying the 
[Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition).

When reviewing a repetition, some information will be hidden to challenge your 
memory. Once you remember the answer or decide to give up, you can press the 
"Show Answer" button to reveal the correct answer. You will then see four 
buttons: **Again**, **Hard**, **Good**, and **Easy**. You should press the 
button that best represents how difficult it was for you to remember the 
answer. Above each button, you will see a time period indicating when the 
app will prompt you to review the repetition again when that button 
is pressed.

In the reviewer, you will also find an edit button. Clicking it will take 
you to the cell in the editor so that you can edit the cell.

## Shortcuts

A set of shortcuts has been added to the reviewer to make your reviewing
experience faster and more efficient:

| Keyboard shortcut | What it does |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Space             | Show answer  |

| 2                 | Hard         |
| 3                 | Good         |
| 4                 | Easy         |
| E                 | Edit         |
