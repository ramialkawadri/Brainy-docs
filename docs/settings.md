# Settings

The app allows you to modify the following settings:

- **Database Location**: All your files, cells, and information used in this 
app are saved in a single database file. The location of this file depends on
the value you enter in this field. It is highly **recommended** to store this
file on a cloud provider, such as Google Cloud, Mega, etc., to help sync your
data across different devices and to prevent data loss.

- **Theme**: This setting allows you to switch between light and dark themes
or follow the system theme.

- **Zoom**: Adjusting this setting will change the zoom level in the app.
