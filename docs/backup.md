# Automatic Backups

The program automatically creates periodic backups of your data in the same
directory where your settings are stored. These backups are saved with
timestamps to help you identify them.

**To restore from a backup:**

1. Navigate to the settings directory
1. Delete the existing `brainy.db` file
1. Rename your desired backup file to `brainy.db`

The program will then use the restored backup when you restart it.
