Brainy provides a powerful set of features for managing your files. Here is a 
list of the available features and how they work:

1. **Creating a Folder**: You can create a folder to group one or more files,
and you can also create subfolders. To do this, press the three dots next to 
any folder and then click on **New Folder**.

2. **Creating a File**: You can create files to store your notes. To do this,
click on the three dots next to any folder and then click on **New File** or
press (Ctrl + N).

3. **Renaming Files and Folders**: You can rename your files or folders by
clicking on the three dots and then clicking on **Rename**, or by pressing F2.

4. **Deleting Files and Folders**: To delete a file or folder, click on the
three dots and then **Delete**, or press DEL. Be aware that when you delete 
a file, all its content is lost and cannot be restored. When you delete a 
folder, all of its files are also deleted.

5. **Moving Folders and Files**: To move a folder or file to another folder, 
you can drag that file or folder to the desired location.

6. **Exporting and Importing**: You can export a folder or file and save it 
on your disk, which can help you share your notes. To do this, click on the 
three dots and then click on **Export**. You can import files similarly.
