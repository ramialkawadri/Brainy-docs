# Sidebar

The sidebar allows you to navigate between the various components of the
system and consists of the following parts:

- **Navigation to Home and Settings**: Quickly access the home page and
system settings.
- **File Management Area**: Manage your files and folders efficiently.

The sidebar can be collapsed and expanded again by clicking on the arrow next 
to the **Brainy** title.

## File management

Brainy provides a powerful set of features for managing your files. Here is a 
list of the available features and how they work:

1. **Creating a Folder**: You can create a folder to group one or more files,
and you can also create subfolders. To do this, press the three dots next to 
any folder and then click on **New Folder**.

1. **Creating a File**: You can create files to store your notes. To do this,
click on the three dots next to any folder and then click on **New File**.

1. **Renaming Files and Folders**: You can rename your files or folders by
clicking on the three dots and then clicking on **Rename**.

1. **Deleting Files and Folders**: To delete a file or folder, click on the
three dots and then **Delete**. Be aware that when you delete 
a file, all its content is lost and cannot be restored. When you delete a 
folder, all of its files are also deleted.

1. **Moving Folders and Files**: To move a folder or file to another folder, 
you can drag that file or folder to the desired location.

1. **Exporting and Importing**: You can export a folder or file and save it 
on your disk, which can help you share your notes. To do this, click on the 
three dots and then click on **Export**. You can import files similarly.

## Shortcuts
