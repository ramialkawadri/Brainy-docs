# Sidebar

The sidebar allows you to navigate between the various components of the
system and consists of the following parts:

- **Sidebar navigation and quick actions**: Use the sidebar to navigate quickly to Home, Search, and Settings, and to perform actions with dedicated buttons for Sync and Help.

- **File Management Area**: Manage your files and folders efficiently.

- **Account management**: The sidebar also contains buttons to manage
your account — including Sign‑in, Sign‑out, Update Account
Information, and deleting your account.

The sidebar can be collapsed and expanded again by clicking on the arrow next 
to the **Brainy** title.

## File management

Brainy provides a powerful set of features for managing your files. Here is a 
list of the available features and how they work:

1. **Creating a Folder**: You can create a folder to group one or more files,
and you can also create subfolders. To do this, press the three dots next to 
any folder and then click on **New Folder**.

1. **Creating a File**: You can create files to store your notes. To do this,
click on the three dots next to any folder and then click on **New File**.

1. **Renaming Files and Folders**: You can rename your files or folders by
clicking on the three dots and then clicking on **Rename**.

1. **Deleting Files and Folders**: To delete a file or folder, click on the
three dots and then **Delete**. Be aware that when you delete 
a file, all its content is lost and cannot be restored. When you delete a 
folder, all of its files are also deleted.

1. **Moving Folders and Files**: To move a folder or file to another folder, 
you can drag that file or folder to the desired location.

1. **Exporting and Importing**: You can export a folder or file and save it 
on your disk, which can help you share your notes. To do this, click on the 
three dots and then click on **Export**. You can import files similarly.

1. **Remembering Expanded and Collapsed State**: The program will remember 
which files were expanded and which were collapsed during your last
session and will retain the state even after restart. This helps maintain
your workflow and allows you to pick up right where you left off next time
you use the program.
