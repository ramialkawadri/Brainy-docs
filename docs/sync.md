# Sync

The app includes built‑in sync functionality that automatically keeps 
your data synchronized across multiple devices.

- **How sync works:** Changes you make on one device are uploaded and
propagated to your other devices so your data stay up to date.
- **Sync conflicts (Last‑write‑wins):** If the same item (for example, a
cell) is modified on more than one device before those changes are
synchronized, the version with the most recent timestamp will
take precedence — the last change wins. This means an earlier change
can be overwritten if a later change is received.
- **Settings options:** In Settings you can enable auto-sync on app start
and on close.
