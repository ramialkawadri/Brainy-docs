# Search

Brainy provides powerful search functionality to help you quickly find your
cells. You can search for text within the current file or across all files.

To search in all files, click on **Search** in the sidebar or press 
(Ctrl + Shift + F). This will display a text field where you can enter 
your search query. Press Enter to view the search results.

To simplify navigation, you can click on any cell and use the focus tools button
to navigate directly to the file containing the cell, where the cell will 
be focused for easy access.
