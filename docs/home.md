# Home

The home area provides an overview of your current files and their repetitions.
For each file, it shows the number of new, learning, and ready-to-review 
repetitions. Folders can be expanded to display their children by clicking
on the "+" icon, and they can be collapsed by clicking on the "-" icon. When
you click on any folder or file, all the repetitions belonging to the files
within that folder, or to the selected file, will be displayed in the reviewer 
for you to review.
