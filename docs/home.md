# Home

The home area provides an overview of your current files and their repetitions.
For each file, it shows the number of new, learning, and ready-to-review 
repetitions. Folders can be expanded to display their children by clicking
on the "+" icon, and they can be collapsed by clicking on the "-" icon. The 
program will remember which folders were expanded and which were collapsed
during your last session, helping you maintain your workflow. When
you click on any folder or file, all the repetitions belonging to the files
within that folder, or to the selected file, will be displayed in the reviewer 
for you to review.

The home area includes a review heatmap that displays several key metrics:
the number of cards studied today, the time spent on each card, and the
total study time. Additionally, it features a comprehensive calendar for 
the entire year, detailing the number of cards reviewed on each day, as well
as the count of cards that are due for review for the remainder of the year.
